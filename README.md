Quick note: the assets for the character are not made by me all rights go to Warren Clark which is the individual who made the character assets. I did include the assets I used however I do encourage you to actually get the assets directly from Warren Clark's itch.io page at the following url: https://lionheart963.itch.io/4-directional-character
